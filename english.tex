\indent

\section{Nouns}
A \textbf{noun} is a word used to identify people, places, or things (\textbf{common nouns}) or to name a particular one of these (\textbf{proper noun}).
\begin{center}
  You can buy \inline{\textbf{coffee}}{Common noun} at \inline{\textbf{Starbucks}}{Proper noun}.
\end{center}
\subsection{Common nouns}
A \textbf{common noun} is a noun showing a class of objects or a concept as opposed to a particular individual\\
\begin{center}
There was a \textbf{sofa}, two \textbf{chairs}, and a \textbf{wardrobe} in the \textbf{room}
\end{center}
\indent
Note that \textbf{common nouns} are general names. \textbf{They are not capitalized unless they begin a sentence or are part of a title}.
\begin{center}
\textbf{Capitals} of the countries are usually very large cities
\end{center}
\begin{center}
London is the \textbf{capital} of Great Britain
\end{center}
\subsubsection{Plural form}
\begin{itemize}
\item Noun $+$ S $\Rightarrow$ Plurar form \\e.g. flower-flowers, dog-dogs
\item Noun ending in $s$, $ss$, $sh$, $ch$, $x$, $z$, $o$ $+$ $es$ $\Rightarrow$ Plural form \\ e.g. bus-buses, watch-watches, box-boxes
\item Noun ending in $f$, $fe$ $\Rightarrow$ Change $f$ into $ve$ $+$ $s$ \\e.g. life-lives, wolf-wolves \quad (but: belief-beliefs, chef-chefs)
\end{itemize}
Remember that some nouns are \textbf{irregular}\\
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Singular} & \textbf{Plural}\\
\hline
man & men\\
woman & women\\
person & people\\
child & children\\
tooth & teeth\\
foot & feet\\
mouse & mice\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Proper nouns}
\subsection{Pronouns}
\subsubsection{Subject Pronouns}
A \textbf{subject} is the person or thing that performs the action in the clause or sentence.

A \textbf{subject pronoun} is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the subject of a sentence

\begin{center}
	\textbf{She} told me about her worries.
\end{center}
Subject pronouns replace nouns that are the subjecto of their clause.

\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		& \textbf{Singular} & \textbf{Plural} \\
		\hline
		$1^{st}$ person & I & we \\
		$2^{nd}$ person & you & you \\
		$3^{rd}$ person & he/she/it & they \\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\newpage
We should replace the subject with a subject pronoun to avoid repetition.
\begin{center}
\textst{Mary is a student and Mary is very hard working.}\\
Mary is a studen and \textbf{she} is very hard working.
\end{center}

We use the subject pronoun \textit{it} when we refer to objects, things, animals, or ideas.
\begin{center}
		\textit{ Love is eternal. \textbf{It} will last forever.}
\end{center}

Sometimes when we don't know the sex of a baby, we can use \textit{it}'.
\begin{center}
	Their baby is so small. \textbf{It} only weights 2 kilos.
\end{center}
\hspace{0.4cm} We use \textit{it} when we talk about time, weather, or temperature.
\begin{center}
	What time is \textbf{it}? - \textbf{It}'s 7 o'clock.\\
	\textbf{It}'s quite cold today.
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Object Pronouns}
An \textbf{object} is the person or thing that receives the action in the clause or sentence.\\
An \textbf{object pronoun} is a pronoun that takes the place of a noun as the object of a sentence.
\begin{center}
	She told \textbf{me} about her worries.
\end{center}

Object pronouns are used to replace nouns that are the direct or indirect object of a clause.
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
	\hline
	\textbf{Subject} & \textbf{Object} \\
	\hline
	I & me \\
	you & you \\
	he & him \\
	she & her \\
	it & it \\
	we & us \\
	they & them \\
	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

Object pronouns come either after a verb or a preposition.
\begin{center}
		Ethan asked \textbf{me} to tal to \textbf{them}.
\end{center}

Note tha the subject pronoun \textit{it} and the object pronoun \textit{it} look the same.

\begin{center}
		Do you know the movie 'Pertty Lady'? \textit{it} is my favourite! (subject pronoun)\\
		I've seen \textit{it} many times. (object pronoun)
\end{center}
Remember that object nouns are always the recipients of the action in sentence.
\begin{center}
		\textst{He and me went to the movies}. \textbf{He and I} went to the movies.\\
		\textst{Mrs. Keith called her and I}. Mrs. Keith called \textbf{her and me}.
\end{center}

We should replace the object with an object pronoun to avoid repetition.
\begin{center}
		I can't stop thinking about Amy. \textst{I can't stop imagining my future with Amy}. I can't stop imagining my future with \textbf{her}.
\end{center}

\newpage
\subsection{Material Nouns}
\textbf{Material nouns} denote a material or substance from which things are made of.
\begin{center}
		a \textbf{plastic} bottle, a \textbf{diamond} ring, etc.
\end{center}
Material nouns are uncountable, thus they do not have a plural form. Generally, articles are not used with material nouns as they are uncountable.
\begin{center}
		\textst{I really want to buy these cottons pants.}\\
		I really want to buy these \textbf{cotton} pants.
\end{center}

Material nouns fall into several categories:
\begin{center}
		\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]]
		\item Related to nature\\
				e.g. air, salt, coal, silver, gold, etc.
		\item Related to animals\\
				e.g. meat, milk, egg, wool, etc.
		\item Related to plants\\
				e.g. cotton, coffee, tea, wood, etc.
		\item Arificial or man-made materiales\\
				e.g. alcohol, cheese, brick, steel, etc.
		\end{enumerate}
\end{center}

\subsection{Compund nouns}
A \textbf{compund noun} contains two or more words which are joined together and form a single noun. Compund nouns can be words written together, words that are hyphenated, or separate words.\\
The first word usually describes or modifies the second word, denoting its type or purpose, Consequently, the second word identifies the item itself.
\begin{center}
		I need to buy a new \textbf{toothbrush}. ( a brus used for cleaning one's teeth)
\end{center}

There is no exact rule as to when we should write compund nouns together, hyphenated, or as separate words. If you are not sure how to write a compund nound, \textbf{consult a dictionary}.
\begin{center}
		Could you go with me to the \textbf{bus stop}?\\
		My \textbf{in-laws} are incredible people.\\
		I love your new \textbf{haircut}! You look fantastic!
\end{center}
Note that the stress usually falls on the first syllable in compund nouns. As a result, the word stress helps to differentiate between a compund noun and an adjective + noun.
\begin{center}
		A \textbf{greenhouse} is a glass building used for growing plants that need warmth, light, and protection. (compund noun)\\
		A \textbf{green house} is a building that someone lives in. This building is painted green. (adjective + noun)
\end{center}
